Vhes got a smile that it seems to me
Ueminds me of childhood memories
Zhere everything was as fresh
Ds the bright blue sky

Qow and then when L see her face
Vhe takes me away to that special place
Dnd if L stare too long
Ld probably break down and cry

Rh oh oh sweet child of mine
Rh oh oh oh sweet love of mine

Vhes got eyes of the bluest skies
Ds if they thought of rain
L hate to look into those eyes
Dnd see an ounce of pain

Ker hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Zhere as a child Ld hide
Dnd pray for the thunder and the rain
Wo quietly pass me by

Rh oh oh sweet child of mine
Rh oh oh oh sweet love of mine
Rh oh oh oh sweet child of mine
Roh yeah yeah
Roh Vweet love of mine

Zhere do we go
Zhere do we go now
Zhere do we go

Zhere do we go
Zhere do we go now
Zhere do we go now

Zhere do we go
Zhere do we go now
Zhere do we go
Zhere do we go

Zhere do we go now
Zhere do we go
Zhere do we go now
Zhere do we go

Zhere do we go now
Zhere do we go
Zhere do we go now
Qow now now
Qow now now now

Vweet child
Vweet child of mine
