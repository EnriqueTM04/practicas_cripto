hey, oh
sheets of empty canvas
untouched sheets of clay
were laid spread out before me
as her body once did
all five horizons
revolved around her soul
as the earth to the sun
now the air I tasted and breathed
has taken a turn
oh and all I taught her was everything
oh I know she gave me all that she wore
and now my bitter hands
chafe beneath the clouds
of what was everything
oh the pictures have
all been washed in black
tattooed everything
I take a walk outside
I am surrounded by
some kids at play
I can feel their laughter
so why do I sear
oh, and twisted thoughts that spin
round my head
I am spinning
oh, I am spinning
how quick the sun can, drop away
and now my bitter hands
cradle broken glass
of what was everything
all the pictures had
all been washed in black
tattooed everything
all the love gone bad
turned my world to black
tattooed all I see
all that I am
all I will be
yeah
I know someday you will have a beautiful life
I know you will be a star
in somebody elseâ€™s sky
but why
why
why can not it be
why can not it be mine
