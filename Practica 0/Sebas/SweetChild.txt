shes got a smile that it seems to me
reminds me of childhood memories
where everything was as fresh
as the bright blue sky

now and then when I see her face
she takes me away to that special place
and if I stare too long
id probably break down and cry

oh oh oh sweet child of mine
oh oh oh oh sweet love of mine

shes got eyes of the bluest skies
as if they thought of rain
i hate to look into those eyes
and see an ounce of pain

her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
where as a child Id hide
and pray for the thunder and the rain
to quietly pass me by

oh oh oh sweet child of mine
oh oh oh oh sweet love of mine
oh oh oh oh sweet child of mine
ooh yeah yeah
ooh Sweet love of mine

where do we go
where do we go now
where do we go
where do we go

where do we go now
where do we go
where do we go now

where do we go now

where do we go now
now now now
now now now now

sweet child
sweet child of mine
